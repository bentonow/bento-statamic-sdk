### User Synchronization Tags

When automatic user synchronization is enabled, you can configure default tags that will be automatically applied to new users when they are synchronized with Bento:

- Choose from your existing Bento tags in the Advanced Settings
- Add multiple tags that will be applied to all new users
- Tags are stored consistently whether using database or file-based storage
- Easily manage tags through the Control Panel interface

#### Example Usage:

If you've selected tags like "new-user" and "needs-onboarding", when a new user registers:
- A subscriber is created in Bento
- The user's name is split into first and last name
- Email and basic user information is synced

This feature allows you to automatically segment new users without any additional configuration.
